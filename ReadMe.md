# My Blood Bank Database

It is uploaded in the Master Branch.

This app was created to fulfill the project requirements for Code Kentucky Software Development Using C# Class

It is an MVC app used to enter and store a patients information, in the hopes of finding a match for blood types.
You are able to use the app to add a donor, edit a donor, and delete a donor. It saves the information in a list in a database and retreives it from a JSON file.

## Features used

I created an additional class that inherits one or more properties from its parent.
I created a list that is stored in a database that you can store and retreive values to use in the program.
I implemented a log that records errors and invalid inputs.
The app uses data from a JSON file and uses that data in the application.



Clicking "Run" will launch the app.
From there you will be able to add or view donors
